It consists on developing a web-site using HTML and Css/Sass, with a pre-made design. We were required to use some good stuff like:

- HTML partials
- Flexbox/ grid
- Responsive design with mediaqueries
- some interactions (using hover with transition/ animation)
- Github
- Other Sass fun things like mixin
