# Module - 1: Final Evaluation

Hi there! this is my final evaluation project for Adalab, hope you like it!
You can see the final product here: http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-1-evaluacion-final-Calpurniax/

> **First things first:** You need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run this project

### Steps to enjoy this lovely code I made:

1. Better **download** it than using git clone.
2. **Install dependencies** by typing the following in a terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project! with:

```bash
npm start
```

## About the evaluation

It consists on developing a web-site using HTML and Css/Sass, with a pre-made design. We were required to use some good stuff like:

- HTML partials
- Flexbox/ grid
- Responsive design with mediaqueries
- Some interactions (using hover with transition/ animation)
- Github
- Other Sass fun things like mixin

#### About the code

The project was typed with Visual Studio Code.
The framework is the Adalab Web Starter Kit, which allows us to enjoy gulp without worries (among other things).

### thank you and have fun!
